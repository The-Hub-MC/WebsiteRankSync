# WebsiteRankSync
Copyright The Hub MC 2016.
This is a plugin designed by Jacksonnn/Videog4mer and Simplicitee for The Hub MC. It syncs Ranks PermissionsEX and XenForo User Groups. If someone is set to a rank on the website (primary user group) then they will be that rank on the server. If someone has a set rank on the server, it will be sent to the MySQL database table that the user's group data is in and be changed/updated.
